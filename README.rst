Upload source distributions of your requirements to your PyPI server.


The problem
===========

If you are using a custom PyPI server as a proxy and want to upload some
packages there, it's not easy.  For each package, you need to download its
source and upload it using ``setup.py`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Uploading requests==2.0.0
    $ git clone https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
    $ cd requests
    $ git checkout v2.0.0
    # Assuming you have 'internal' index-server configured in your '~/.pypirc'.
    $ python setup.py sdist upload -r internal
    # Uploading coverage==3.5
    $ cd ..
    $ git clone https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy
    $ cd coveragepy
    $ git checkout coverage-3.5
    $ python setup.py sdist upload -r internal

You could also download the packages directly into the PyPI's index directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh pypi-mirror.yourdomain.com
    $ pip install requests==2.0.0 coverage==3.5 -d ~/.packages

If there's more than one package, you could use a requirements file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ scp requirements.txt pypi-mirror.yourdomain.com:.
    $ ssh pypi-mirror.yourdomain.com
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt -d ~/.packages

But it's still too much.  You should be able to do it with one command.
And what if you don't have SSH access to the PyPI server host?


The solution
============

One command for download and upload.


Upload packages by name
-----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pypiupload packages mock==1.0.1 requests==2.2.1 -i internal


Upload packages from requirements file
--------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pypiupload requirements requirements.txt -i internal


Upload source distribution files
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pypiupload files packages/mock-1.0.1.tar.gz \
      packages/requests-2.2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl -i internal


More options
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pypiupload --help
    $ pypiupload <command> --help
