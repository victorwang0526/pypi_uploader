        Upload source distributions of your requirements to your PyPI server.
        
        
        The problem
        ===========
        
        If you are using a custom PyPI server as a proxy and want to upload some
        packages there, it's not easy.  For each package, you need to download its
        source and upload it using ``setup.py`` script:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # Uploading requests==2.0.0
            $ git clone https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
            $ cd requests
            $ git checkout v2.0.0
            # Assuming you have 'internal' index-server configured in your '~/.pypirc'.
            $ python setup.py sdist upload -r internal
            # Uploading coverage==3.5
            $ cd ..
            $ git clone https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy
            $ cd coveragepy
            $ git checkout coverage-3.5
            $ python setup.py sdist upload -r internal
        
        You could also download the packages directly into the PyPI's index directory.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ssh pypi-mirror.yourdomain.com
            $ pip install requests==2.0.0 coverage==3.5 -d ~/.packages
        
        If there's more than one package, you could use a requirements file.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ scp requirements.txt pypi-mirror.yourdomain.com:.
            $ ssh pypi-mirror.yourdomain.com
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt -d ~/.packages
        
        But it's still too much.  You should be able to do it with one command.
        And what if you don't have SSH access to the PyPI server host?
        
        
        The solution
        ============
        
        One command for download and upload.
        
        
        Upload packages by name
        -----------------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pypiupload packages mock==1.0.1 requests==2.2.1 -i internal
        
        
        Upload packages from requirements file
        --------------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pypiupload requirements requirements.txt -i internal
        
        
        Upload source distribution files
        --------------------------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pypiupload files packages/mock-1.0.1.tar.gz \
              packages/requests-2.2.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl -i internal
        
        
        More options
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pypiupload --help
            $ pypiupload <command> --help
        
        
        Supported PyPI servers
        ======================
        
        Tested only on `pypiserver <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiserver>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install from PyPI::
        
            $ pip install pypi-uploader
        
        Or go to the root directory with **setup.py** script and install it::
        
            $ python setup.py install
